    "My goal here is to collect housing prices for both rental and sale in New York city. I looked at three major real estate website including Trulia, Zillow, and StreetEasy. Comparing to the other two websites, StreetEasy gives the most information on the searching results page and the format of each listing is very consistent, which is great for the purpose of web-scraping.<br\\ >\n",

    "\n",
    "Web scraping is done using the beautifulsoup package in Python. I created two functions that can loop through all the pages of searching results, and also empty strings to store results. Below are the steps I took to scrape StreetEasy:\n",
    "1. Analyzing the HTML page: HTML code of a web page can be viewed by right click and selecting 'Inspect'. This helps us identifying the HTML tags of the information to be scraped\n",
    "2. Making the soup!: It is important to select the correct parser for your data type. I used HTML parser.\n",
    "3. Navigating the parse tree and iterate through tags: once the soup is made, we have the HTML code in Python. We can then find our desired information by searching through HTML tags."
